I am pursuing my PhD in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.mit.edu/) in the [Uncertainty Quantification Group](https://uqgroup.mit.edu/home) at MIT, advised by Youssef Marzouk and affiliated with the [Laboratory for Information & Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu/).


My research lies at the intersection of **stochastic modeling and statistical inference** with **mechanics and dynamics** of physical systems across multiple scales, from macroscropic engineering structures to microscopic atomic environments. My interests are broadly in:

* <span style="color:orange">Uncertainty Quantification:</span> How can we estimate and improve the level of confidence we have in a prediction? 
* <span style="color:orange">Parameter Estimation and System Inversion:</span> How can we solve for a model capturing the underlying mechanism which produces the data? 
* <span style="color:orange">Small Data Problems:</span> How can first-principles physics be leveraged in extrapolatory settings, or in applications where data is sparse? 
* <span style="color:orange">Stochastic Dynamics:</span> How can we approach statistical inference by drawing inspiration from stochastic dynamical systems?

As an engineer and researcher, I am motivated to advance climate and energy resilience, human health and well-being, and education equity through my work.
