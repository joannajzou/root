#### We advance the state-of-art in predictive simulation of materials, using a multi-scale approach of bridging quantum, atomistic, and continuum scales by means of modern statistical inference and uncertainty quantification techniques.

The Center for the Exascale Simulation of Materials in Extreme Environments (CESMIX) seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in predictive simulation by connecting quantum and molecular simulations of materials with state-of-the-art programming languages, compiler technologies, and software performance engineering tools, underpinned by rigorous approaches to statistical inference and uncertainty quantification.

Our motivating problem is to predict the degradation of complex (disordered and multi-component) materials under extreme loading, inaccessible to direct experimental observation. This application represents a technology domain of intense current interest, and exemplifies an important class of scientific problems â€” involving material interfaces in extreme environments.

My primary contribution is in developing components of [PotentialLearning.jl](https://github.com/cesmix-mit/PotentialLearning.jl), a Julia library for the active learning of machine learning interatomic potentials. In particular, I work on Bayesian inference frameworks for training machine learning interatomic potentials, which allow for uncertainty propagation to observable quantities from molecular dynamics simulation.
